Description
-----------

html2epub1 is a tool to convert valid XHTML 1.0 Strict files to EPUB2. It is provided by https://github.com/skreutzer/text_processing/.


Requirements
------------

A proper Java SDK must be installed to produce the *.class files. The source code is at least compatible with Java 1.6 (OpenJDK).


Installation
------------

Type

    make
    make install

in the directory containing the package's source code. By default, 'make install' installs the html2epub1 program files in '/usr/local/bin/html2epub1/'. You may specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local/' by giving 'make' the option 'PREFIX'. Example:

    make install PREFIX=~/

You may also set the /bin directory manually:

    make install BINDIR=~/my_bin/  <-- custom /bin


Execution
---------

Type

    java html2epub1 config-file

Either your working directory has to be 'BINDIR/html2epub1/', or the CLASSPATH environment variable must contain it.


Usage
-----

The transformation process is driven by the XML-based configuration file, which needs to be passed as argument for the program call. The html2epub1 software package contains an example 'config.xml', where two input files are specified by <inFile>. Since every input file will reflect a "part" in the resulting EPUB file, the 'title' attribute specifies the name of the part for the table of contents. <xhtmlSchemaValidation> should be always set to 'true', for which to take effect

    http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd

should be downloaded and saved in the html2epub1 installation directory. It might only be set to 'false', if the input XHTML files got already validated and weren't changed since. <outDirectory> specifies where html2epub1 will place the temporary output files. Those files can also be packed to EPUB manually by

    zip -X0 "out.epub" "mimetype"
    zip -Xr "out.epub" "META-INF" "content.opf" "toc.ncx" "page_1.xhtml" "page_2.xhtml" "image_1.png" "image_2.png"


Missing features
----------------

@font-face file references in CSS, absolute paths for links and referenced images, table of contents based on <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6> headers (with option to choose up to which level of headings), refuse to write invalid output (check the existence of anchor target IDs).
