Description
-----------

html2epub is a tool to convert valid XHTML 1.0 Strict files to EPUB2.
It is provided by https://github.com/skreutzer/text_processing/html2epub/html2epub/.


Requirements
------------

A proper Java SDK must be installed to produce the *.class files.
The source code is at least compatible with Java 1.6 (OpenJDK).


Installation
------------

Type

    make
    make install

in the directory containing the package's source code. By default, 'make install'
installs the html2epub program files in '/usr/local/bin/html2epub/'. You may
specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local/' by giving 'make' the
option 'PREFIX'. Example:

    make install PREFIX=~/

You may also set the /bin directory manually:

    make install BINDIR=~/my_bin/  <-- custom /bin


Execution
---------

Type

    java html2epub config-file

Either your working directory has to be 'BINDIR/html2epub/',
or the CLASSPATH environment variable must contain it.


Usage
-----

The transformation process is driven by the XML-based configuration file,
which needs to be passed as argument for the program call. The html2epub
software package contains an example 'config.xml', where two input files
are specified by <inFile>. Since every input file will reflect a "part" in
the resulting EPUB file, the 'title' attribute specifies the name of the part
for the table of contents. <xhtmlSchemaValidation> should be always set
to 'true', for which to take effect www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd
should be downloaded and saved in the html2epub installation directory. It
might only be set to 'false', if the input XHTML files got already validated
and weren't changed since. <outDirectory> specifies where html2epub will
place the temporary output files. Since the zip processor is still missing,
there won't get a EPUB file generated, so it has to be created manually:

    zip -X0 "out.epub" "mimetype"
    zip -Xr "out.epub" "META-INF" "content.opf" "toc.ncx" "page_1.xhtml" "page_2.xhtml" "image_1.png" "image_2.png"


Missing features
----------------

Zip processor, no support of CSS in <head>, other image file types than PNG,
absolute paths for links and referenced images, table of contents based on
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6> headers (with option to choose up to
which level of headings).
